# Expressive Writing System - Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Expressive Writing System (EP) is a Django-based web application designed to facilitate therapeutic writing through AI-guided sessions. The system uses OpenAI's API to create an intelligent writing coach that guides users through structured writing exercises about significant life events.

## Core Features

### 1. User Profile Management
- **UserProfile Model**: Stores biographical context and writing goals
- Personalized experience based on user background
- Custom writing goals tracking

### 2. Event Management
- **Event Model**: Organizes writing sessions around specific life events
- Fields: title, description, date_occurred, current_phase
- Tracks progress through writing phases

### 3. Four-Phase Writing Process
Each event goes through four distinct writing phases:
1. **Factual Description**: Objective recording of what happened
2. **Emotional Response**: Exploration of feelings and emotional impact
3. **Behavioral Associations**: Connection to patterns and future actions
4. **Positive Reframing & Growth**: Finding benefits, lessons learned, and setting future goals

The fourth phase is based on research showing that positive reframing and benefit-finding in expressive writing leads to:
- Enhanced emotional resilience and optimism
- Goal-oriented thinking and self-improvement
- Balanced emotional processing
- Long-term behavioral change

### 4. AI-Guided Progression
- Intelligent phase progression based on writing completeness
- AI evaluates user's writing depth and readiness
- Automatic transition between phases when criteria are met
- Special "PHASE_COMPLETE" marker system

### 5. Chat Interface
- Real-time interaction with AI writing coach
- Contextual guidance based on current phase
- Persistent chat history per writing phase
- New thread creation for each phase transition

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **Models**
   - `UserProfile`: User-specific settings and goals
   - `Event`: Writing event management
   - `UserThread`: Chat session management

2. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Custom assistant creation with phase-specific instructions
   - Thread management for continuous conversation
   - Automated phase progression evaluation

3. **Views**
   - Event CRUD operations
   - Chat interface
   - Profile management
   - Writing session management

### Latest Progress

Most recent updates include:
1. Implementation of AI-guided phase progression
2. Enhanced assistant instructions for phase-specific guidance
3. Automatic thread management for phase transitions
4. Progress bar visualization of writing phases
5. Improved user feedback during phase transitions

## Current Status (Updated Dec 3, 2023)

### Working Features
- Basic chat functionality with OpenAI integration
- User authentication and profile management
- Event creation and management
- Phase-based writing sessions
- Context-aware AI responses

### Known Issues
1. **Chat Functionality**
   - Save chat function not working
   - Missing typing animations (three dots and AI response)
   - Phase progression needs manual confirmation (checkbox needed)

2. **UI/UX Issues**
   - Event detail page tabs not clickable
   - Chat history not loading in tabs
   - Missing visual feedback during AI responses

### Next Development Sprint
1. **High Priority**
   - Implement save chat functionality
   - Fix event detail page tab interactions
   - Add typing animations for better UX
   - Add phase progression checkbox

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Add loading animations
   - Improve visual feedback
   - Enhance tab navigation

3. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Manual phase progression with checkbox
   - Better chat history organization
   - Improved session management

## Next Steps
Potential areas for enhancement:
1. Analytics dashboard for writing progress
2. Export functionality for writing sessions
3. Enhanced feedback mechanisms
4. Group sharing capabilities
5. Writing prompts library

## Dependencies
- Django 5.1.3
- OpenAI API
- Bootstrap for UI
- Python 3.11.10

## Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Django's built-in security features
- CSRF protection
- User authentication required for all features

# Development Summary

## Recent Updates (December 1, 2024)

### Database Migration to PostgreSQL
- Added PostgreSQL database integration in Railway.app
- Updated database configuration to use Railway's PostgreSQL instance
- Configured database URL through environment variables

### Security and Performance Improvements
- Fixed SSL/HTTPS redirect issues
- Resolved infinite redirect loop problems
- Updated security settings in settings.py:
  - Disabled SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT (handled by Railway)
  - Added SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER
  - Maintained secure cookie settings

### Static Files Configuration
- Added proper static files handling
- Created static directories structure
- Fixed static files warning in production
- Updated STATIC_URL configuration
- Added automatic creation of static directories

### Progress Bar Implementation
- Implemented progress tracking in event_list.html
- Added visual progress indicators for writing phases
- Fixed styling issues with progress bars

### Next Steps
1. Ensure all migrations are applied in the new PostgreSQL database
2. Monitor application performance with the new database
3. Consider adding database backup procedures
4. Add more user feedback mechanisms
5. Enhance error handling and user notifications

## Project Overview
This is an expressive writing platform that helps users process and reflect on significant life events through guided writing exercises. The application uses AI to facilitate meaningful self-reflection and personal growth through structured writing phases.
