# Session Summary - December 4, 2023

## Overview
Today's session focused on fixing and improving the chat saving functionality in the Expressive Writing System. We encountered and resolved several issues:

### Completed Tasks
1. **Chat Saving Functionality**
   - Verified that chat sessions are being saved successfully
   - Confirmed that sessions appear in the event detail page
   - Fixed an OpenAI rate limit error by waiting between requests

### Technical Details
1. **Model Changes**
   - Added `json` import to `models.py` for proper JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Confirmed `ChatSession` model is working as expected

2. **View Changes**
   - Attempted to enhance the event detail view to display saved chat sessions
   - Rolled back changes when they caused server errors
   - Maintained the existing progress bar display

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Cleaned up the base environment by removing unnecessary packages:
     - whitenoise
     - django-health-check
     - python-dotenv
     - dj-database-url
   - Updated project documentation with correct Miniconda environment path: `C:\Users\X1\miniconda3\envs\ep`

### Current State
- Chat saving functionality is working
- Sessions are being saved and appear in the event detail page
- Basic functionality is restored and stable

### Next Steps
1. **UI Improvements**
   - Design and implement a better way to display saved chat sessions
   - Add proper formatting and styling for chat messages
   - Consider adding a way to view historical sessions by phase

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement better handling for OpenAI rate limit errors
   - Add user feedback for rate limit errors

3. **Testing**
   - Test chat saving functionality across different phases
   - Verify proper loading of saved chat sessions

4. **Security Enhancements (Priority)**
   - **Client-Side Encryption**
     - Implement Web Crypto API for browser-based encryption
     - Generate unique user encryption keys
     - Encrypt all chat content before server transmission
     - Server to store only encrypted data
   
   - **Data Export Feature**
     - Create endpoints for complete data download
     - Support both PDF (readable) and JSON (data) formats
     - Include all writing sessions, events, and chat history
     - Add metadata for potential reimport
   
   - **Secure Deletion ("Nuke") Feature**
     - Implement selective and complete data removal
     - Secure data overwriting before deletion
     - Add confirmation steps and audit logging
     - Option to download data before deletion

### Notes
- The OpenAI rate limit error suggests we might need to implement rate limiting or request queuing
- Consider implementing a more robust error handling system for API calls
- The chat session display could be improved in future iterations
